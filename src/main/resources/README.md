## CyborgNoodle

### Project Structure

#### Specific /r/gorillaz server classes
- `ServerUser` enum of regular users and their IDs + timezone
(use `CyborgNoodle.getUser(ServerUser)` to get the API User)

- `ServerChannel` enum of all channels on the server and their IDs
(use `CyborgNoodle.getChannel(ServerChannel)` to get the API Channel)

- `ServerRole` enum of all roles on the server and their IDs
(use `CyborgNoodle.getRole(ServerRole)` to get the API Role)

### Todo list
(feel free to implement this yourself, as I am probably too lazy to do it)

- *nothing at the moment*
